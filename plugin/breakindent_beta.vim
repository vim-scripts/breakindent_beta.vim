" BreakIndent Beta tries to make wrapped lines look neater and less disruptive, by updating showbreak to indent them to the same column as the currently focused line.
"
" Warning: Because it changes showbreak, it can cause lines to shift up and down when a new indent is applied.  Either enable breakindent_never_shrink or put up with it!
"
" Unlike the original breakindent, it cannot present a different indent for each line.  Instead it updates the showbreak option to fit the indent of the current line.
"
" Naturally this requires :set wrap in order to work.  If you don't need visible tabs, you could also :set nolist .  And now you can finally disable auto-wrapping with :set textwidth=0 wrapmargin=0 or perhaps :set formatops-=cq
"
" BreakIndent Beta is a pure vimscript alternative to the old breakindent patch, which I failed to get working smoothly in modern Vim.

" When set to 1, this will stop breakindent from changing so often

" This SINGLE char will be used to display the indent
let g:breakindent_char = " "

" This string will be appended after the indent, then the line will follow
let g:breakindent_symbol = "\\\\ "

" This replaces the symbol with a gap that varies according to the length of the first word in the current line.  This can help text after a // or # or " comment to align neatly.  Not for use with breakindent_never_shrink.  Also worth noting this restricts updates to occur only when focused on lines which wrap.
